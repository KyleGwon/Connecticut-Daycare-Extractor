    - Use the command ```cd ..``` to move out of a directory
5. Move your .txt file to the same directory as the **ct_daycare_extractor.py** file.
6. Run the command ```python3 ct_daycare_extractor.py [input file name].txt [output file name].csv```
  - Where:
    - **[input file name]** is the name of the .txt file you created
